# N3RVE Platform Dependency Compatibility Report

Generated: 2025-07-27

## Executive Summary

The N3RVE platform frontend is using React 19.1.0, which is a very recent release. While most dependencies are relatively up-to-date, there are several compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities that need attention.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities (2 found)

#### High Severity
- **xlsx (0.18.5)**: 
  - Prototype Pollution vulnerability (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6)
  - Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9)
  - **Action Required**: Consider migrating to a more secure alternative like `exceljs` or `@sheet/core`

#### Critical Severity
- **form-data (4.0.0-4.0.3)**: 
  - Uses unsafe random function for choosing boundary (GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4)
  - **Action Required**: Run `npm audit fix` to update to a patched version

### 2. React 19 Compatibility Issues

#### Confirmed Incompatible Libraries
1. **framer-motion (12.23.9)**
   - Known incompatibility with React 19
   - Animation features broken in React 19
   - Alpha version (12.0.0-alpha.0) available but unstable
   - **Recommendation**: Wait for official React 19 support or consider alternatives

#### Lint Errors Related to React 19
1. **Missing React imports**: Multiple files have `'React' is not defined` errors
   - Files affected: AudioPlayer.tsx, FileUpload.tsx
   - **Fix**: Add `import React from 'react'` to affected files

2. **Missing DOM type definitions**: `MouseEvent` and `Node` are not defined
   - Files affected: ContributorForm.tsx, DatePicker.tsx, DateTimePicker.tsx
   - **Fix**: Import types from React: `import { MouseEvent } from 'react'`

3. **React Hook Rules violations**: Improper hook usage in non-component functions
   - File affected: ArtistSelector.tsx
   - **Fix**: Move hooks to component level or create custom hooks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Fix Security Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```
   
2. **Replace xlsx library**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall xlsx
   npm install exceljs
   ```

3. **Fix React 19 Import Issues**
   - Add React imports to affected files
   - Import DOM types from React

4. **Fix React Hook violations**
   - Refactor hook usage in ArtistSelector.tsx

### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)
1. **Monitor framer-motion**
   - Track GitHub issue #2668 for React 19 support
   - Consider alternatives: react-spring, auto-animate, or CSS animations

2. **Update minor versions**
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

3. **Consider Tailwind CSS v4 migration**
   - Review breaking changes
   - Plan migration strategy

### Long-term Actions (Low Priority)
1. **Zod v4 migration**
   - Review API changes
   - Update validation schemas

2. **TypeScript and ESLint updates**
   - Keep development dependencies current
   - Review new rules and features

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Security & Compatibility (Week 1)
- Fix all security vulnerabilities
- Resolve React 19 import/type issues
- Fix hook violations

### Phase 2: Stability (Week 2)
- Monitor framer-motion for issues
- Implement fallback animations if needed
- Update minor dependency versions

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3-4)
- Plan major version migrations
- Implement performance monitoring
- Review bundle size impact

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. Bundle size changes after updates
2. Runtime performance (especially animations)
3. Build time impact
4. Error rates in production

### Tools Recommended
- Bundle analyzer: `vite-bundle-visualizer`
- Performance monitoring: React DevTools Profiler
- Error tracking: Sentry or similar

## Conclusion

The N3RVE platform is generally well-maintained with modern dependencies. The main concerns are:
1. Two security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention
2. React 19 compatibility issues with framer-motion
3. Minor code fixes needed for React 19 compliance

Most dependencies are compatible with React 19, and the platform is using current versions of major libraries. With the recommended fixes, the platform should be stable and secure.
